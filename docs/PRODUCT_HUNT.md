## 完整描述

### The Problem
Creating product demo videos is time-consuming:
- Manual screen recording requires multiple takes
- Syncing voiceover with visuals is tedious
- Any product update means re-recording everything

### The Solution
Demo Video Generator automates the entire process:

📝 **Write a simple script** - Define scenes in YAML/JSON
🎙️ **Auto-generate narration** - AI text-to-speech in 40+ languages
🎬 **Automatic recording** - Browser automation captures everything
🔄 **Perfect sync** - Audio and video align precisely
📄 **Subtitles included** - SRT files generated automatically

### How It Works
```yaml
scenes:
  - id: homepage
    url: "https://yourapp.com"
    narration: "Welcome to our product..."
    actions:
      - type: scroll
        y: 500
```

Run one command:
```bash
demovideo generate --script demo.yaml --output video.mp4
```

Get a professional video in minutes, not hours!
